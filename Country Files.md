## Type

Type defined what type of a country a tag is, e.g. building based country, society of pops etc. 

The different options are:
default - normal location based countries (countries default to this, so type does not need to be defiened for these countries)
pop - society of pops
building - building based country
army - army based country

## Regnal Numbers

If the country uses regnal numbers for its rulers, they should be defined alongside the ruler as shown in the example. By default a ruler will not have a regnal number, but this can also be set manually by setting the regnal number to 0. 

Usually regnal numbers start from 1, but if the numbers can be set to start from a different number with the regnal_numbers command. This command takes a list of names with a number. This number sets the number of previous rulers for the listed name, so in the example any future John would have a regnal number of 3, as the file considers there to have been 2 previous Johns for that tag.
