## Cities

Some locations may have cities. For such locations, as city section needs to be added. This section is to have two arguments: rank and setup. Rank can be none, town or city. Setting the rank to none sets the location to not have a city. Setup must be a valid town setup defined in in_game\common\town_setups

---

## Buildings

Buildings are defined in a separate section. Each building must have a level defined. Setting the level to zero removes the building. Buildings can also have an owner defined. The owner should only be defined if it is different from the location owner.
