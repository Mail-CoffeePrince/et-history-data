# Location files

Location data is recorded in yml format as shown below. Each location has its own file, sorted in folders by continent, subcontinent, region and area.

## Cities

Some locations may have cities. For such locations, as city section needs to be added. This section is to have two arguments: rank and setup. Rank can be none, town or city. Setting the rank to none sets the location to not have a city. Setup must be a valid town setup defined in in_game\common\town_setups

---

## Buildings

Buildings are defined in a separate section. Each building must have a level defined. Setting the level to zero removes the building. Buildings can also have an owner defined. The owner should only be defined if it is different from the location owner.

---

## Pops

Pops are defined in a separate section. Each pop entry has as its indentifier the ethnicity of the pop and the religion of the pop separated by a hyphen. The pop entry can take its argument in two different ways.

A pop entry can be given a number as an argument. In this case the estate distrubution is automatically determined. Alternatively, the argument can be a set of entries with an estate as the key and a number as the value.

The number values are not absolute population figures, as the total population of a location is defined in a separate file. This total population is then divided proportionally between all the pops in the location. For example if pop A has a value of 1 and pop B has a value of 2, pop A will get a third of the total population in the location and pop B will get the other two thirds.
